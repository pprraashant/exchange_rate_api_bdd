Feature: Exchange Rates
  As a User
  I want to be able to have an automated testing framework available which covers different scenarios for the Rates API
  So that I can make sure that the APIâ€™s are fit for purpose in the use of the exchange rate for financial reasons


  Background:
    #Given Rates API for Latest Foreign Exchange rates


  @rates
  Scenario Outline: Latest rate available
    When The API is available <param>
    Then assert the success status of the response
    Then assert the response
    Then assert the response is expected
    Then assert the date <param1>
    Examples:
      |   param     |   param1      |
      | "latest"    | "2020-11-26"  |
      | "2020-11-27"| "2020-11-27"  |
